# I18n assets

Ever wanted to use rails localization helpers inside your assets? Your dream just came true!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'i18n-assets'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install i18n-assets

## Usage

Just add `.erb` extension to your `.js` and `.css` files and use standard I18n helpers inside your files.

On assets precompilation localized versions of your files will be generated.

If you need to prevent `.js.erb` or `.css.erb` files from caching, you can add `config.assets.prevent_caching = true` to the `environments/development.rb` file.

## Configuration

By default, `i18n-assets` localizes all js and css files. That might make your deploys turtle slow. In order to explicitly configure the files you want to localize, simply add `config.assets.localize = %w( *.js application.css )` to your environment configuration file.
